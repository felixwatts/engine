# Introduction

This is a Java game engine built on [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx). I used it to create several games including [zipzap](https://github.com/felixwatts/zipzap)

It makes extensive use of [Aurellien Ribon's Tween Engine](https://github.com/AurelienRibon/universal-tween-engine)

This code was never intended to be public so please excuse the lack of comments etc.
